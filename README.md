# Gloria - static site generator

*gloria is spanish for glory, also the name of my mom and the name was available in npm*

**V2 is deprecating lots of old functions, make sure to read the migrating docs.**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gloriajs/gloria.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dvidsilva/gloria)

This project aims to be a substitute for [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), to help you create static websites without depending on ruby.

## Community

We're going to have a discord or something some day.

## Installation

Install globally or per project.

For more information check our [website](https://gloriajs.github.io).

Add the `@gloriajs` scope to your `.npmrc` or your project before installing. If added globally it only needs to be done once, but is better to add it on each project so your collaborators don't have to do it too before getting started.

```
@gloriajs:registry=npm.pkg.github.com
```
Install by
```
npm i @gloriajs/gloria
```

# Usage

Now gloria is globally installed in your computer, and you can run commands like `gloria --version` to retrieve the version. Or if installed per project you can use npx.
