#Gloria - static site generator
*gloria is spanish for glory, also the name of my mom and the name was available in npm*

This project aims to be a substitute for
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), to help you
create static websites without depending on ruby.

**WARNING: this is a work in progress** it only has
access to a very limited set of features, and support can be
dropped in any moment.

#Installation

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install.

```
npm install -g gloria
```

#Usage

Now gloria is globally installed in your computer, and you can run commands
like `gloria -v` to retrieve the version.

#Development and contributing

Fork and clone the repo. Then run `yarn` to install the
dependencies.

Run `npm link` inside the repo to use your local Development
version instead of the globally installed one.

Add changes, commit and open a pull request. It's preferable if
you open an issue first, or look at the open issues and assignments
before working, to make sure you're not overlaping with other contributors.

#Troubleshooting

I'm currently using:

```
node v6.4.0
npm 3.10.3
```

Try upgrading your version of node and run `yarn` again. Or open
an issue describing your problem.
