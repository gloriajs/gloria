Our open source community is a group of people committed to developing awesome software that Works.
Every other concern is subordinate to this goal.
We recognize that there are certain kinds of childish behavior that are unwelcome in our community.
We respond to such behavior by generally ignoring and/or—in extreme cases—making sport of, individuals who engage in such behavior.
We accept everyone's contributions, we don't care about your personal life! In fact, we won't bring it up, or ask.
Those conversations have no place in the repo, issues or community spaces unless it refers to accesbility, inclusion or other important features of the tool.
Repeat offenders will get mocked and banned.
If you need to complain about someone's behavior or report something we suggest to message the maintainers.
